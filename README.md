## Introduction

This module outlines the essential steps in the process of analyzing proteomics data and recommends commonly used tools and techniques for this purpose. It assumes a simple experimental design for differential abundance including two experimental conditions such as cancer vs normal. The training data provided utilized TMT10plex multiplex design with MS3 data acquisition. This notebook describes mass spectrometry and statistical terminology for data preprocessing, normalization, and differential abundance analysis. Note: This notebook uses simple base R plots. These can be modified to learn how to build better publication quality plots using R. 

## Requirements

This tutorial was designed to be used on cloud computing platforms, with the aim of requiring nothing but the files within this github repository.
The Jupyter Notebook file can run on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Service, and Microsoft Azure provided the R packages are installed. The Notebook can be launched using NIH STRIDES training module and therefore requirements should only require access NIH STRIDES resources.
